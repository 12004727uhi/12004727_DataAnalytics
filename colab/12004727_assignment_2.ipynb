        "\n",
        "For the linear regression model, every possible combination of the weather and temporal features from imported datasets will be modelled, with the model run 5 times (each time with newly shuffled data of randomised order). \n",
        "\n",
        "The model 'learns' patterns during the 'training' phase, then makes predictions for a separate set of unseen data in the 'validation' phase. The datasets are split into these 'training' and 'validation' sets during model configuration (here, the split will be 80% of the dataset for training and 20% for validation).\n",
        "\n",
        "One additional smaller dataset is reserved for testing the model's performance on data that was unseen during both the training and validation phases. This is used to mitigate issues whereby a model may be optimised to perform so well on the validation data that it is, in fact, 'over tuned' to predict patterns that may be inherent only to the training and validation data. Such scenarios, in essence, 'over fit' the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Machine Learning practitioner Dr Brownlee summarises the differences between these datasets thus:\n",
        "\n",
        "> - Training Dataset: The sample of data used to fit the model.\n",
        "- Validation Dataset: The sample of data used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a model fit on the training dataset while tuning model hyperparameters. The evaluation becomes more biased as skill on the validation dataset is incorporated into the model configuration.\n",
        "- Test Dataset: The sample of data used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a final model fit on the training dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "(Brownlee 2020).\n",
        "\n",
        "Each model is run here 5 times. Following each model run, its RMSE is calculated (RMSE will be further defined later in this document).\n",
        "\n",
        "The median of those 5 RMSE results, for each combination of features (predictors), is calculated and recorded. For the sake of brevity, the results of each model run are tabulated in the full results text files only if the median RMSE for the 5 runs of the model is under 1.0. A value higher than 1.0 suggests the model performs poorly (albeit based over only 5 model runs). All median RMSE results are, however, recorded and tabulated.\n",
        "\n",
        "For each model run, a \"Mean model\" is also calculated. The Mean model reflects the RMSE btween the collision values in the validation data and the mean value of total collisions in the training data (i.e., the sum of all normalised collision values in the training data, divided by the number of data points (dates)). \n",
        "\n",
        "The RMSE of the linear regression model should be 'better' (lower in value) than that of the Mean model, to indicate that the regression model is working as a better predictor than simply using a line of best fit as proposed by the Mean model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Models are then tested using the imported test sample datasets, to determine how well they perform on new data that was not used for training or validation.\n",
        "\n",
        "This may serve to detect aforementioned 'over-fitting' to the training data, which can happen when a model accurately predicts relationships intrinsic to the training and validation data, but which do not translate to new, unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The test datasets are small (mostly only 10 rows of data), owing to the relatively small size of the orginal datasets. This renders the test results highly susceptible to 'noisy' and 'bad' data, such as outlier values. The test is run once for every model run, with the RMSE between the prediction and the real (normalised) value calculated each time. The median of the test RMSE values is then calculated, to compare against the median RMSEs for the validation data, which was obtained during the model's train and validate phase.\n",
        "\n",
        "To illustrate method, an example of the linear regression modelling process will be stepped through and described in detail for the modelling of the first predictor of the dataset `2013 to 2018` [`linear_1.csv`], modelling the predictor of day of week [`day`]. This will occur in subsection 3.1.1, below, and serves to demonstrate process.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thereafter, linear regression modelling will proceed in the same way for all datasets and predictor selections, using a semi-automated linear regressor process, the code of which was authored for this purpose and is included below (in runnable state).\n",

        "For the sake of brevity, the modelling process will not be elaborated each time, but results will be recorded in tabular form for each dataset and uploaded in full to Github.com, from where they will be linked to below (Github Inc. 2021). A ranked table of median RMSE results over the 5 model runs will be presented in the subsections below that are dedicated to each dataset.\n",

These values were arrived at through numerous rounds of experimentation and are considered optimum for the purpose of modelling for this report. They remain unchanged for all linear regression modelling, in order to produce outcomes for each model and dataset that are suitable for comparison on a like-for-like basis. \n",

The difference between every observed and forecast value (residual) is squared, then the mean of those squared values is taken (the sum of the squared values is divided by how many there are). Finally the square root of that mean value is calculated to yield the RMSE.\n",

        "\n",
        "Only 1 dataset produced models with median RMSE results under 0.1 - `2013 to 2019 - Bronx County` [linear_6.csv]. It seems evident that, of the datasets imported, Bronx County was an outlier in the set, demonstrating very different collision dynamics than either the non-spatial datasets or even the dataset for Bronx, Kings and Queens Counties combined. No other dataset produced models with median RMSEs below 0.159.\n",
        "\n",
        "The threshold of below 0.1 that would signify a 'good' model (as defined earlier), was therefore met only 33 times (all for predictor combinations on the Bronx County dataset). Results under 0.2 were obtained for every model however, indicating some fairly reasonable models were produced - albeit not highly nor consistently predictively accurate.\n",
        "\n",
        "For all predictors, the RMSEs between predicted results and the data, on both the training/validation and testing datasets, show a degree of variability. This is why the median RMSE values over 10 training/validating runs and 5 testing runs were calculated. \n",
        "\n",
        "Although 10 runs was low (albeit necessary to stay within the scope and restraints of this report), it was sufficient for preliminary testing and provided a useful indication of whether the selected predictors showed promise in terms of informing future development of more complex and highly tuned linear regression models.\n",
        "\n",
        "The input datasets were relatively tiny and noisy; despite the 'data cleaning' performed during the data science (in part 1 of this report), the data was very variable in nature and prone to unrepresentative 'bad data'.\n",
        "\n",
        "This variability renders linear regression modelling problematical - an issue that was observed during the train/validate/test process. As described on the online statistics resource StatsTutor: \"Simple linear regression is appropriate for modelling linear trends where the data is uniformly spread around the line.\" (2021). From the data science in part 1 of this report, it is evident that the data is highly variable and therefore a 'line of best fit' is going to be far from perfect, even once clear outliers have been removed.\n",
        "\n",
        "In all datasets, the rate of increase in median RMSE results (i.e., rate at which models became 'poorer' predictors), appeared to increase the further down the ranking table the models dropped. For instance, the difference between the 50th and 25th ranked models was always at least four times the difference between the first and 25th ranked models. This suggests that the choice of predictor(s) affected the model accuracy to a significant extent, sufficient to demonstrate that the better ranked models are working, to some degree, as the spread of the 'better' models was bunched at the top of the tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "The relatively small range of RMSE results at the top of the ranking tables indicate that there was no single 'stand out' data feature that heavily influenced model accuracy, either by itself or in combination with other predictors. That there was so little difference in the median RMSE results for predictor combinations at the top of the tables mitigates against the likelihood of any 'stand-out' predictors being able to produce a highly accurate and reliable model for these datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the top end of the ranking tables, the testing RMSEs were generally very close to the model's performance on their own validation data, with the notable exception of the dataset \"2013 to 2019 - First 175 Days of Years [linear_4.csv]\", and over fitting to the test data was generally not in evidence.\n",
        "\n",
        "In general, the difference between the model's performances on validation and test data did become more variable as a function of a decreasing linear model accuracy, on most datasets. However, the test datasets were small and that increases the likelihood of outlier data-points distorting the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "In terms of beating the Mean model, all datasets here did at least produce a minimum of 12 models where that was accomplished. A 'good' or even 'reasonable' RMSE simply indicates that a linear regression model does have prediction potential; the measure of the capacity of any given model to achieve an optimum linear regression solution - such that it is worth tuning and deploying - is judged here in terms of how it performs as compared to the simple Mean model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Running the code block below produces table 15, which ranks datasets by the number of linear model RMSEs that bettered the Mean model RMSEs. \n",
        "\n",
        "The table shows that the leading dataset was \"2013 to 2019 - First 175 Days of Each Year\" [linear_4.csv], with 30 linear models that exceeded the performance of the Mean model. However, the test results with this model were very different to the model's validation data RMSEs (although actually superior on the better performing models). This may be due to very small size of the test dataset - it was only 5 rows of data, rather than the usual 10, owing to the smaller size of this dataset (it contained only around half the data, covering just 175 days per year). Overfitting during training is also a possibility here, owing to the relatively tiny size of this dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Datasets `linear_1.csv`, `linear_3.csv` and `linear_2.csv` were relatively close in the number of 'better than mean' linear models, with 27, 24 and 23 respectively. The two datasets with spatial data, `linear_5.csv` and `linear_6.csv`, were both trailing the field, having almost half the number of 'better than mean' linear models than the nearest of the other datasets, at 12 and 11, respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "This may suggest that separating the counties was not conducive to producing 'better' linear regression models - indeed, the opposite seems the case in terms of the 'better than Mean model' results, even in light of an apparent advantage for spatial datasets (like Bronx County) in producing more accurate predictions as measured by lower RMSE values. \n",
        "\n",
        "However, in such cases, the inconsistency between seemingly good RMSE results yet poor performance in terms of 'beating the Mean model' may be attributable to the smaller size of the available data containing spatial information. As discovered during the data science, there were 215,523 fewer collision records present in the dataset containing spatial data (for all counties combined). In general, too few data points can result in poor training performance and thus poorly performing models. As described by Machine Learning practitioner Dr Brownlee: \"too little training data results in a poor approximation. An over-constrained model will underfit the small training dataset\" (Brownlee 2020a).\n",
        "\n",
        "It is important to note, being that so many collisions were unrepresented in these datasets (due to lack of geographical coordinates), some data bias may be distorting the true picture. Highly variable data, such as worked with here, is more prone to be unrepresentative of general patterns in circumstances when there are less data-points available to model."

        "\n",
        "Here, the datasets created for the deep neural network will be imported and modelled.\n",
        "\n",
        "As with linear regression, the 'Adam Optimizer' is used. The DNN may be configured and tuned in the quest for superior results, with a key configuration being the `learning_rate` hyperparameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "As described by machine learning reseacher and practitioner Jason Brownlee PhD on the machinelearningmastery.com website, \"learning rate controls how quickly the model is adapted to the problem... too large can cause the model to converge too quickly to a suboptimal solution, whereas a learning rate that is too small can cause the process to get stuck... It may be the most important hyperparameter for the model\" (Brownlee 2020b).\n",
        "\n",
        "The DNN regressor is a \"Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)\" - an artifical neural network with at least one layer. This means that another important setting is the `hidden_units` parameter, which refers to the number of 'hidden layers' in the deep neural network. Brownlee suggests that one of the best methods of configuring the number of hidden layers is to \"use systematic experimentation to discover what works best for your specific dataset.\" (Brownlee 2020b).\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, the imported datasets are tested with a configurations and predictor combinations chosen with a view to producing well functioning models.\n",
        "\n",
        "The choice of configuration hyperparameters (i.e. learning rate and hidden layers) was established during rounds of testing and tuning. Different combinations of predictors were also tested for modelling each dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Every combination of the following hyperparameter options were run on every model. The results of all of these runs are available from the Github repository as linked below at the end of this section.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hyperparameter options run were:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `learning_rate` choices: 0.5; 0.1; 0.01; 0.001\n",
        "- `hidden_untis`: [10, 9, 7]; [20, 18, 14]; [40, 36, 28]; [80, 72, 56]\n",
        "\n",
        "The 'best obtained result' for each dataset - modelled using all predictors of the dataset - are presented in tables below. These 'best efforts' represent the outcomes where the DNN model's RMSE results were superior to (lower than) the Mean Model's RMSE results - and the difference between those two values were at their greatest. In the event no DNN model for a dataset was superior to the Mean Model, the 'best effort' is considered to be the model where the difference is at its smallest.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consideration is also given to the value of the DNN model's median RMSE result in and of itself, with lower values indicative of better predictive potential.\n",
        "\n",
        "All datasets were also modelled with temporal data predictors removed (i.e. day of week, month, year, 'day index' since records began), and weather data predictors removed. This was done to ensure that the temporal and weather features were modelled both with and independently of each other, to establish whether either 'class' of predictor was significantly influencing the results for any given dataset. Should any of these models produce results where the median RMSE of the DNN model is less than the Mean model RMSE (i.e. indicating the DNN model is working better than the Mean model), the 'best obtained results' from this additional modelling for each dataset are again presented in the tables below. Results for datasets where this additional modelling failed to produce DNN models that 'beat' the Mean Model will not be tabulated.\n",
        "\n",
        "The selected configuration variables and predictors used for each model are indicated above each table. \n",
        "\n",

This issue is exacerbated when the dataset sizes are small - as is the case here (and more-so with the spatial datasets). Therefore, further modelling with additional data, combined with more robust testing with a larger test set would be necessary to rule out overfitting.\n",

        "That there was no greater predictive advantage over the Mean Model in those models exhibiting sub 0.1 RMSE scores, was disappointing.

As a model's RMSE for its validation data increases (i.e. as the model shows greater prediction errors), there is a trend (although apparently not linear) towards increasing disparity between the model's performance on its validation data and the test data. This is as may be expected.\n",

However, the differences were too small to draw any definitive conclusions here.\n",

        "It is concluded that the high variability of the datasets used here rendered them unsuitable for highly and reliably accurate linear regression modelling. For the purpose of this report, an RMSE below 0.1 is considered to demonstrate 'good' predictive potential. That only one dataset produced linear models with RMSE results under 0.159 would attest to a lack of high quality linear regression prediction potential in all but one of the datasets used. \n",

This may be improved through tuning model hyperparameters and could be worth pursuing for spatially bound areas (i.e. Counties/Boroughs) within New York City."

        "It was found that the best results for DNN modelling ('good' RMSEs, under 0.1) were achieved by modelling datasets for discrete geographical areas (i.e., Counties/Boroughs) independently. \n",

        "A tightly spatially bound model would take account of more localised environmental factors such as: topographical; meteorological; quality and availability of local infrastructure; population; and so forth. The influence of such factors on DNN modelling of traffic collision rates are suggested areas for further research. \n",
        "\n",
        "It is also the case that modelling for smaller, discrete regions has the effect of reducing variability of input data, in terms of removing from the dataset patterns that may be generated by circumstances that are spatially specific to other regions. Potential for erroneous 'bad data' and anti-patterns within the input data is reduced as a function of spatial specificity of the dataset.\n",

        "\n",
        "Only 1 dataset - \"2013 to 2019 - All Counties Combined\" produced a delta of greater than 0.1 between between the DNN model RMSE and the Mean Model RMSE results. Although many of the models did demonstrate predictive capability, the DNN models did not perform exceptionally better than the Mean Models. Only 2 of the 6 models yielding 'good' predictive potential - '2013 to 2019 Richmond County with no temporal data' and '2013 to 2019 Bronx County - using all predictors' - also produced superior predictions to the Mean Model. However, this advantage over the Mean Model was only by the slimmest of margins, such as to render it essentially insignificant.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the result of the DNN modelling was disappointing. It was hoped that the DNN would yield more accurate predictions than Linear Regression, owing to being more appropriate for the multivariate nature of the data. However, this theoretical advantage did not manifest in practice, with the linear models out performing the DNN on similar datasets. This may be the result of insufficient training data, such that the DNN was unable to identify deeper patterns in the data that might otherwise serve to its advantage.\n",
        "\n",
        "DNN model predictive accuracy may certainly be enhanced with hyperparameter 'tuning', and perhaps the addition of more spatially specific data features. The close proximity of most modelling results to the test data does appear to confirm predictive potential (the tiny size of the test sample notwithstanding)."

        "It was found that linear regression modelling was generally unsuitable as a predictive tool for the datasets modelled in this report, owing to the variability of the multivariate input data. \n",
        "\n",
        "Datasets that produced 'good' predictive performance from linear regression modelling were limited to Bronx County, although outcomes from modelling other datasets were not entirely unreasonable, with all datasets producing models that exhibited a slightly superior performance to the Mean Model. This suggests that development of better tuned models for individual counties may yield beneficial results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unfortunately, no greater success was observed using deep neural network modelling (DNN), however similarly to linear regression, better results were obtained when applied to tightly spatially bound areas within New York City. Only 2 models ('2013 to 2019 Richmond County' with no temporal data, and '2013 to 2019 Bronx County' using all predictors) were found to combine a 'good' RMSE result with superior predictions to the Mean Model - and only just. The margin was so tiny as to render the advantage over the Mean Model insignificant. Similarly to linear regression, the best results were obtained by modelling spatially bound areas. \n",
        "\n",
        "Development of more finely tuned DNN models focussed on individual boroughs/counties may increase the advantage over the Mean model. If that is pursued, it is worth noting that the removal of weather data from the modelling seemed to consistently produce DNN models that were superior to the Mean Model, ergo predictions for tightly bounded spatial areas based on temporality may be productive.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both the linear regression and DNN modelling appeared to suffer from a lack of sufficient high quality input data, and as a result may have been constrained from producing better outcomes.\n",

        "It is therefore concluded that, based on the modelling conducted here, using weather features to predict the number of collisions for any given temporal period in New York City did not produce reliably accurate results.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, both linear and DNN modelling may be potentially useful predictive tools if the models are developed as described above and use more, good quality input data. Fine tuning of the DNN model's hyperparameters may yield further improvements to the model accuracy."
